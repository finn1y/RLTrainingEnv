# RL Trainging Environment

A training environment for reinforcement learning algorithms using [open-ai gym](https://gym.openai.com/)

## Included Algorithms

Both single agent and multi-agent reinforcement learning algorithms are included within the learning environment
Any single agent algorithm can be used as an independent multi-agent learning algorithm with the multi-agent environments

#### Q-Learning

#### Deep Q-Network (DQN)

#### Deep Recurrent Q-Network (DRQN)

#### Policy Gradient (PG)

#### Advantage Actor Critic (A2C)

#### Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG)

#### Multi-agent Actor Critic (MA Actor Critic)

#### Distributed Deep Recurrent Q-Network (DDRQN)

## Included Environments

Several of openai gyms' environments are included as single agent environments are included, as well as some custom 
environments which have both single agent and multi-agent variations

#### [Maze](https://github.com/MattChanTK/gym-maze)

#### [Robot Maze](https://github.com/finn1y/gym-robot-maze)

#### [Cart Pole](https://gym.openai.com/envs/CartPole-v1/)

#### [Acrobot](https://gym.openai.com/envs/Acrobot-v1/)

#### [Mountain Car](https://gym.openai.com/envs/MountainCar-v0/)
