# Dependency Patches

This directory contains patches for dependencies of the RL training environment

## Applying Patches

To apply a patch to a git repository then:

1. copy the patch into the relevant repo
2. move to that repo
3. apply the patch with `git apply <patch_name>.patch`

taking `gym_maze_multi_agent.patch` as an example:

```
cp ./gym_maze_multi_agent.patch <path_to_installed_repo>/gym-maze/
cd <path_to_installed_repo>/gym-maze/
git apply gym_maze_multi_agent.patch
```

Note: if installed using pip in a virtual env then the repo may be located in the virtual env's directory under "src"

To view what the patch changes either by looking in the `.patch` file or by using the `git diff` command after applying the patch.
